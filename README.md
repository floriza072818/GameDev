# Music and Sounds					
						
●	The music should have a Retro style, appealing to 8 bit nostalgia but high quality.
 							
●	It’s important that a lot of sound effects praise the user when she does something good. There should be immediate and positive feedback.
 							
●	The sad scenes should be accompanied by piano/violin music and sound like a sorrowful Tango.
 							
●	For In-Game music, use a more relaxed approach with serious and happy tunes and going up on tempo as the level progresses. 


# Technical Description	
						
The game will be Mobile Cross-platform: iOS, Android, Windows Phone. Follow with PC standalone version and Facebook Canvas.
